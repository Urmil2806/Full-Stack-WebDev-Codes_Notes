<!-- Problem Statement: Creating a Blog Webpage with Multimedia Embeds

You have been assigned the task of creating a blog webpage using only HTML. The webpage should include text content, images, and multimedia embeds from YouTube and Twitter.

The blog webpage should have the following features:

1. Blog Content: Write engaging and informative blog content on a topic of your choice. The content should consist of paragraphs and headings, appropriately formatted using HTML tags.

2. Hyperlinks: Include relevant hyperlinks within the blog content using the HTML `<a>` tag. These hyperlinks can direct users to external websites, related articles, or other resources.

3. Images: Enhance the visual appeal of the blog by adding images that are relevant to the topic. Use the HTML `<img>` tag to insert and display the images.

4. Videos: Embed a video within the blog post to provide additional information or visual content. You can use HTML5 video tags or any other suitable method to embed the video.

5. YouTube Embed: Integrate a YouTube video related to the blog content. Utilize the YouTube embed code provided by YouTube to embed the video into the webpage.

6. Twitter Embed: Include a Twitter post or feed related to the blog content. Use the Twitter embed code provided by Twitter to embed the post or feed into the webpage.

Ensure that the blog webpage is well-structured, with a clear layout and proper formatting of the text content. The images, videos, YouTube embed, and Twitter embeds should be appropriately positioned within the blog post, enhancing the overall user experience.

Your task is to create an HTML file that incorporates the above features, using the relevant HTML tags and embed codes to display images, videos, YouTube embeds, and Twitter embeds effectively within the blog webpage. -->

        By Aakash Sharma: Threads, Meta's answer to Elon Musk's Twitter, is set to be
        launched on July 6 amid the raging debate on how the upcoming application will
        collect user data. Netizens are pointing at privacy concerns of Threads, saying the
        app is collecting more user-related data than Twitter.
        A preview of Instagram's text-based conversation app is now available on the App
        Store in India that allows us to take a deeper look into data collection by the two
        microblogging platforms. Threads may not have a simultaneous launch in EU countries due to stricter
        privacy rules. Ireland's Data Protection Commission has reportedly said that
        Meta's new service may not be rolled out in the EU at this time.

    <h3>Threads vs Twitter: Data Collection</h3>
    <p>India Today's OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) team analyses the data collection
        practices of both the microblogging platforms, Twitter and Threads, and
        unearthed a significant discrepancy. Of the 25 categories of varying user-
        generated information, Threads was found to collect additional data that Twitter
        does not. Notably, Threads collects some sensitive information such as physical
        address, health and fitness data, and Other User Contact Info and other sensitive
        information within the app.
